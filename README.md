## • What is BedWars1058 Arena Setup

Are you tired and lazy to use commands for setting up Bed Wars Maps? this is a plugin for you!

This plugin will help you set up your arenas more easier than you think. It will give you items to setup your Waiting Lobby Spawn, Teams Bed, Teams Generator and more by using Items instead of Commands!

## AUTO SET GENERATORS:
Since version 3.0, we added an experimental feature which automatically finds and sets generators by using an algorithm. Basically, the plugin finds emerald and diamond blocks that are stair blocks around (it is common in bed wars maps). This is a beta feature. If you encounter any issues, please report it through discussion.

## INSTALLATION:
1. Stop your server.
2. Download the plugin and put it in your plugins folder.
3. Start your server.
